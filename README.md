MRForecaster.jl
===============

This is a port of Forecaster from [Chen & Kipping
(2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08614) from the original Python 2 script,
which can be found [here](https://github.com/chenjj2/forecaster), into Julia.

This script predicts a planetary radius for a given mass (or vice-versa), taking
into account measurement uncertainties, model-fitting uncertainties, and an
intrinsic radius dispersion. Please read the original paper for more details.

Still a work in progress, feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs.
